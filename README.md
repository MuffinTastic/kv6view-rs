# kv6view-rs
![caco.kv6](kv6view-rs.png)

this has no support for changing sensitivity or anything as of yet, it's just a silly tool i threw together in a day for fun

for now, the "configuration" is just hardcoded in `src/controls.rs`

## compiling and running

as simple as `cargo run -- <file>` :)

## other stuff

thanks to mat^2 (Mathias Kaerlev) for the... uh, *inspiration*
